    <h1>London</h1>
    <p>London is as much about innovation as tradition; it’s a place that’s impossible to finish discovering, where the promise of something new is always in the air. This is a city where history is quite literally around every corner – where the ruins of an old church can be found hidden amid skyscrapers, where pop-up restaurants come and go while the monarchy still reigns. London is where old meets new, physically and culturally. Despite being a city that runs on rules and etiquette, London’s sprawling parks, street art, festivals and food markets make it the perfect place to roam free. And “free” is the key word here – from renowned museums to public art, many of London’s best activities are offered without charge.

    <h3>London Culture</h3>
	<p>The UK’s capital is a giant metropolis split into areas as distinct as villages, and London culture is as diverse as its population with over 250 languages spoken across the city. Head to the East End, home of Cockney rhyming slang, Sunday markets and an ever-expanding crop of quirky bars and pubs; enjoy theatre, comedy, jazz and more in Soho, the buzzing centre of London’s gay scene; stay central for the top restaurants, or galleries and museums if you’re searching for more traditionally cultural days out in London; and venture south of the River Thames for nightlife hotspots such as Brixton and Peckham.</p>
